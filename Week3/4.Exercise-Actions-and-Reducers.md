# Actions and Reducers Exercise

**GOAL**: Create Action Creators and a Reducer.  We'll also see how testable Action Creators and Reducers are! ðŸš€ 

### 1 - Action Creators

1. Create two functions, `deposit` and `withdraw`, which are action creators.  These creators should
    - Accept an `amount`, a number.
    - Return an action, with a `type` (all caps version of the function name) and `amount`, the amount passed in.
2. This should pass the first 2 automated tests

### 2 - Reducer
1. Create a reducer function that, like all reducers, takes:
    - A state, defaulted to the `initialState` that should also be declared above, with value of `{ balance: 0 }`
    - An action, which is an object with a `type` and `amount`.
2. The reducer should return
    - The new state, which is an object with just one property: `balance`.
3. This should pass all remaining tests
