# Redux Actions

One of the most important things to recognize about actions is that they do not mutate state. In fact, the reducers are the things that actually determine the new state. That brings up another question: Why is a reducer called a reducer, anyway?  

Reducers are meant to take all the information passed to them and "reduce" down the data to a single store state. Much like [Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) can be used to reduce an entire array to a single number, string, or object, the Redux reducer is used to take an action object with a type and payload and produce the same thing every time: the new state.

## Try It Out üíª
> If you click "Run" on the IDE, it will only error at this point, since we haven't written any reducer. üò± 

1. Create an `initialState` and use that as the first argument of the `reducer` function.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    const initialState = {balance: 0};
    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    // more soon!
    };
    ```

    </details>

2. If the `action.type` is `'DEPOSIT'`, return a new state object with the previous `state.balance` added to the `action.amount`.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    if(action.type === 'DEPOSIT'){
        return {balance: state.balance + action.amount}
    };
    ```

    </details>

3. Otherwise, just return the `state`.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    if(action.type === 'DEPOSIT')
        return {balance: state.balance + action.amount};
    else
        return state;
    };
    ```

    </details>

4. Finally, create the store by passing our `reducer` to the `createStore` function imported from redux.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    const store = createStore(reducer);
    ```

    <details>
7. Now, click "Run" on the IDE, and it should log the initial state and then the updated state.

## Knowledge Check ‚úÖ

1. What is the single source of truth?  The place we should always look to know what the current state is?
    - **Store**
    - Reducer
    - Action

2. Click the line where the store state gets updated.
    ```JavaScript
    store.getState();
    store.dispatch({type: 'DEPOSIT', amount: 100});
    store.getState();
    ```
    - `store.getState();`
    - **`store.dispatch({type: 'DEPOSIT', amount: 100});`**
    - `store.getState();`
