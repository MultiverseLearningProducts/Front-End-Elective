# Redux Action Creators and Reducers

As we begin to build our redux architecture, we'll realize there are many different types of actions, with many different potential payloads. We will need a way to easily and predictably produce these actions with all the necessary boilerplate.

Enter the Action Creator. Action Creators enable us to call a function with a payload, ensuring that the action produced is in the correct format and ready to be consumed by our reducer. ‚≠ê <span style = "color: #21B581">**Action Creators give us a simplified way to dispatch actions in Redux.**</span>

## What We Will Learn
- Why Not Just Actions?

## Try It Out üíª

1. Let's write a couple Action Types! Create one for `ADD` and one for `SUBTRACT`.
    <details>

    ```javascript
    const ADD = 'ADD';
    const SUBTRACT = 'SUBTRACT';
    ```

    </details>

2. Next, write the action creators. These should just take in an `amount` and output the object with both the `type` (from above) and the `amount` passed in.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    export const add = amount => ({
    type: ADD,
    amount
    });

    export const subtract = amount => ({
    type: SUBTRACT,
    amount
    });
    ```

    </details>
3. Click "Run" on the IDE, and it should log the two action objects from the Action Creators!
4. Create the reducer. Remember that we need an initial state. Initialize it with `{ number: 0 }`. Next, pass that initialState as the default to the first argument to the `createStore` function.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    const intialState = { number: 0 };
    const store = createStore((state = intialState, action) => {
        // more to come later
    };
    ```

    </details>
5. Use a [switch statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) to determine what the case should be depending on the passed-in [action.type](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers#designing-actions).
    <details>

    ```jsx
    const store = createStore((state = intialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        // more to come
    }
    });
    ```

    </details>

6. Whether the case is `ADD` or `SUBTRACT`, return the appropriate new store state.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    const store = createStore((state = intialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'ADD':
        return { number: state.number + action.amount };
        case 'SUBTRACT':
        return { number: state.number - action.amount };
        // one last piece here
    }
    });
    ```

    </details>

7. Make sure to add a `default` case: just return the `state` unchanged!
    <details>

    ```jsx
    const intialState = { number: 0 };
    const store = createStore((state = intialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'ADD':
        return { number: state.number + action.amount };
        case 'SUBTRACT':
        return { number: state.number - action.amount };
        default:
        return state;
    }
    });
    ```

    </details>

8. The console should show the store state before and after a dispatched action!

## Knowledge Check ‚úÖ

1. Why do we save our action types in constants?
    - **To reduce human error when typing out the constant name.**
    - Redux requires all action types to be saved in constants.
    - We don't. It's not best practice to save our action types in constants.

2. Click the line of the payload in our action.
    ```javascript
    const myAction = {
        type: 'ADD',
        amount: 15,
    }
    ```
    - `const myAction`
    - `type: 'ADD',`
    - **`amount: 15,`**
