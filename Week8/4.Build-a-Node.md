# Exercise - Build a Node

We‚Äôre going to build a Linked List. Before we do that, let‚Äôs build and understand a `Node`. Nodes are the meat & potatoes of a linked list, and without them a linked list is neither linked nor a list.

Their responsibility is simple, they only need to do 2 things:
- Store a piece of information
- Store a reference to the next node

And, in some cases they can do a third thing:
- Store a reference to the previous node

## üìù

> We‚Äôve already added some sample cases to test your `Node` class. Feel free to add more `Node`s and more `console.logs` to test it out further!

### 1. `Node` should take a value and store it as the property `value`
- When we create a new instance of `Node` we should be able to pass a value, and that value should be stored in the Node under the property `value`
- Run the tests. This should PASS test 1

### 2. Node should have a next property
- Since the 2nd responsibility we know a node needs is to store a reference to the ‚Äúnext‚Äù thing in the list, give your `Node` class a `next` property and set its value to `null`.
- Run the tests. This should PASS test 2

### 3. Node should have a previous property
- What we‚Äôve built so far (in just a couple lines of code!) is the node for a Singly Linked List. That‚Äôs great, but let‚Äôs make our Nodes a little more robust. Give your `Node` class a `previous` property and set its value to `null`.
- Run the tests. This should PASS test 3
