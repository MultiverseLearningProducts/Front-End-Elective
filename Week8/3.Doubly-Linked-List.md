# Doubly Linked List

A Linked List seems like a perfect option for storing commits on of different sizes across different locations on BitStash! Every time an engineer commits something, we’ll just add a reference from the commit that was previously the last commit, to the new commit. Now we can look at any commit in history and know what comes after it.

Unfortunately this still leaves 1 problem. If we take a look at any commit, we can see what commit comes after it, however we can not see what commit was before it. So unless we always start at the head of the linked list, we won’t be able to search through commits in an efficient way! We can only start at the head (which could be 2500 commits ago) and go 1 by 1 to the next to find what we’re looking for. If we take a look at the most recent commit (the tail), we couldn’t see the commit just before it.

## Doubly Linked List Structure

A doubly linked list has an identical structure to linked list, but also points to the previous node as well as the next node in the list.

## Knowledge Check ✅

1. Given a doubly linked list, what would be stored in the “Previous” property of the list’s Head node?
    - **null**
    - Same value as the “Next” property
    - It would point to the Tail of the list
    - It would point to itself

2. Which 3 properties does every Doubly Linked List’s Node contain?
    - **Value**
    - **Next**
    - **Previous**
    - Size

3. Given the following Doubly Linked List and the node we want to add, which node(s) need(s) to be modified to place the new node in the proper location?

    Frank <=> Michelle <=> Kimbo ==> null
                        ^
                    Samantha
    ```
    - **Michelle, Kimbo, and Samantha**
    - Michelle and Kimbo
    - Frank, Michelle, and Kimbo
    - Samantha and Kimbo
