# Exercise - Singly Linked List

Similarly to the nodes we previously built, a linked list has just a few key responsibilities. Since the node is responsible for maintaining a connection from one node to the next, **the linked list is responsible for making the connections in the first place.**

Since there are 2 key properties of a linked list: head and tail, there should be (at least) 2 methods on the linked list that we can interact with - `addToHead` and `addToTail`.

## 📝

### 1. `LinkedList` should have a `head` and `tail` property

- When we create a new instance of `LinkedList` the list should implicitly have a `head` and `tail` property (both set to null). We shouldn’t have to do anything to get those properties, they should just come with the list when we [“new it up”](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/new+it+up)
    ```javascript
    // example
    const list = new LinkedList();

    console.log(list.head); // null
    console.log(list.tail); // tail
    ```
- This should PASS test 1

### 2. `addToHead` method

What good is a Linked List if we can’t add any nodes to it!
- `addToHead` should take a `node`, and add that node to the `head` without removing or overwriting existing nodes
- If the linked list consists of just a single node after adding to head, that node should be *both* the `head` and `tail`. (In other words: if we create a linked list and only add 1 node to it, both `head` and `tail` should refer to the node.)
- **TIP**: first check to see if there is already a head present, if there is it will change the outcome.
- This should PASS test 2

Need help? Here’s some pseudocode:

<details>

IF there is already a head

```plaintext
THEN the the new head’s `next` should point to the previous head
```

IF there’s not already a head

```plaintext
THEN that means the list is empty, and the new head should also be the tail
```

</details>


### 3. `addToTail` method

- `addToTail` should take a node, and add that node to the tail without overwriting previous nodes.
- Just like `addToHead`, if the linked list consists of just a single node after adding to tail, that node should be both the `head` and `tail`.
- **TIP**: Follow a very similar set of pseudocode steps as you did for addToHead to work through the logic of “if there is already a tail, what needs to happen? if there is not already a tail, what needs to happen?”
- This should PASS test 3
