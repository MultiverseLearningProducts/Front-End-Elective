# Exercise: Form Pop-Up and Shake

![Final Output](./assets/6.Final.gif)

**GOAL**: Create a form that shakes when clicked.

Take a moment to look through the starting code:
- The HTML includes a form with one input and a button.
- The JS includes a reference to the input and button, in addition to setting a ‚Äòclick‚Äô event listener on the button that when clicked will adding the class of `shakey` to the button and input. Then, via `setTimeout`, after 500ms (or 0.5 seconds) `shakey` will be removed from the button and input.
- The CSS includes a bit of boilerplate styles to beautify the form, input, and button. There‚Äôs 3 main spots we‚Äôll be working in, .form (to add the pop-in), `@keyframes` pop-in, and `@keyframes` shake.

### 1. Form pops-in on page load

1. Inside of of the `slide-in` keyframes, add a `from` and `to` property
2. `from` should include a `transform: translateY(50vh);` which is 50% of the view height
3. `to` should be the default location of the form of `transform: none`
4. On the `.form` add the `animation-name` of `slide-in` in addition to `animation-duration` of `0.4s` and `animation-timing-function` with `cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.2)`.
5. The `scale` transform piece changes the size (or, scale) of an element. Update the `from` value from step 2 with `transform: translateY(50vh) scale(0.1);`

### 2. Shake the form when the button is clicked

1. Add one set of selectors for all of the even percentages in increments of 10
    - `20%, 40%, 60%, 80% { /* transform here */ }`
    - Add a transform of `translateX(1%)`
2. Add another set of selectors for all of the odd percentages in increments of 10
    - `10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% { /* transform here */ }`
    - Add a transform of `translateX(-1%)`
3. When the button is clicked, the form should shake back-and-forth.
