# Exercise: Reactive Menu Button

![Completed exercise example](./assets/5.Final.gif)

We’re going to build a cool reactive hamburger button! Take a moment to look through the starting code. 
- The HTML (`index.html`) is very simple with a single <nav> element and a button inside.
- In the JS (`index.js`) we’re grabbing a reference to the button.
- Inside of the CSS (`style.css`) there’s a bit more going on. We’ve defined a few custom [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) that we’ll be re-using a few times.

**GOAL**: When the button is clicked, the middle line disappears, the top line rotates 45º and moves slightly down, and the bottom line also rotates 45º and moves slightly up.

## 📝

> Use only `transition` and not `animation`

### 1. When the hamburger is clicked, toggle the `.hamburger--open` class name

**In `index.js`:**
1. Add a 'click' event listener on the hamburger reference, that when fired will toggle the class name "hamburger--open"
    ```javascript
    hamburger.addEventListener("click", () => {
        // code here
    })
    ```
2. When the hamburger is clicked, the middle line should disappear! When clicked again it should reappear.

### #2. Add transitions

1. Add this to `.hamburger-inner`, `.hamburger-inner::before`, and `.hamburger--inner::after`:
    - `transition: all 0.4s ease-in-out;`
2. Now the middle line should be slowly disappearing and reappearing.

### 3. Rotate the top and bottom lines

1. Add a `transform` of `rotate(45deg)` to the `.hamburger-—open .hamburger-inner::after`
2. Add a `transform` of `rotate(-45deg)` to the `.hamburger—open .hamburger-inner::before`
3. For both `.hamburger-—open .hamburger-inner::after` and `.hamburger—open .hamburger-inner::before` rulesets, add a `top` of `calc(var(--hamburger-layer-height) * 2)`

## Knowledge Check ✅

1. Check this box when your hamburger menu button is transforming from a 3 line button into an X when clicked similar to the gif above (required)
