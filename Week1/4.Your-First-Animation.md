# Exercise: Your First Animation

![example completed exercise](./assets/4.FinalImage.gif)

**GOAL** Animate a blinking box, with 3 modifications: background color, text color, and border radius.

## üìù

### 1. Build the `blink` animation to ‚Äúblink‚Äù the colors

We already have:
    - A `div` with the class of `container`
    - Some vague styling on the `container`
    - A `keyframe` named `blink` with 2 keyframe selectors, `from` and `to`. 

**TASK**: Let‚Äôs get our background and text color‚Äôs swapping back and forth
1. Add the `animation-name` of blink
2. Inside from define our ‚Äústarting point‚Äù, add a background of `#333` (or, any dark color), and a color of `white`
3. Inside to define our ‚Äúending point‚Äù, which has the colors reversed.

### 2. Add the `blink` animation to our `.container`

**TASK**: Make the container actually blink! For an animation to occur, we need at least 2 things - the animation name, and a `duration`.

Inside `.container`:
1. Start by adding an `animation-name` of `blink`
2. Add an `animation-duration` of `1s`
3. To make the animation blink repeatedly, add an `animation-iteration-count` of `infinite`. 
4. Add an `animation-direction` of `alternate`

### 3. Round the corners of the container with each blink

1. Inside of the `keyframe`, in the `to` section, add a `border-radius` of `48px`.
2. **OUTPUT** We should now see both the container color and text color blinking back and forth between white and black, and the corners of the container should be rounding with each blink!

## Knowledge Check ‚úÖ
1. Check this box when your animation is blinking and it matches the gif above (required)
    - My animation is blinking and it matches the gif above

## Bonus

Currently we‚Äôre just using from and to in the keyframe, but there are ways we can customize keyframes even more!

**TASK**: Animate using percentages rather than `to` and `from` in order to create a more dynamic animation.

```css
/* example */
@keyframes blink {
	0%, 100% {
		/* defines properties at the starting and ending point */
	}

	50% {
		/* defines properties at the half-way point */
	}
}
```
