# Animations With CSS

If you look at all of the apps and websites that you use day-in and day-out, animations are all over them!

You may not have even noticed them before, but after today's lesson I guarantee you will start spotting them everywhere üòÑ The best ones are small and almost unexpected. Try "hearting" a song in Spotify, or thumbs-up a video on YouTube, or like a post on facebook, did you ever notice those cool animations?

> Like buttons are some of the most satisfying things web developers ever make. Don't believe me? Just try [searching "like button" on Codepen](https://codepen.io/search/pens?q=like+button). (Here's an [adorably satisfying like button](https://codepen.io/aaroniker/full/VwwxopM) feature cat paws high-fiving each other!)

## Transitions vs. Animations

CSS animations can be broken down into two distinct categories: transitions and animations. Most animations are actually transitions.

<span style ="color: #FE4646">**Transitions**</span> are an element changing from one state to another. CSS transitions allows for programmers to change property values smoothly, over a given duration. These are usually subtle and in most situations transitions will me your go to! [Open this CodePen](https://codepen.io/stevenjlance/pen/eYPyLYo) and hover your mouse over the square below to see an example of a 2 second width transition.

<span style ="color: #FE4646">**Animations**</span> are vastly more powerful than transition and can include any number of stages. Animations require an `@keyframes` rule that controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining style for keyframes along an animation sequence. [This example](https://codepen.io/stevenjlance/pen/LYgeJVG) uses 4 `@keyframes` with each one representing a different color (red, yellow, blue, and green).
