# JavaScript Frameworks vs. Libraries
Imagine you have found one of the best restaurants.

Unfortunately, there is ***only*** one person running the entire restaurant. What could go wrong?
- The one person is, obviously, going to be very busy even when there are not many customers.
- If that one person is sick, the whole restaurant goes down.
- If this one person quits, you'll need to find someone who can cook, wait tables, take reservations, and everything else that running a restaurant entails.

This example is precisely why we divide complicated programs into smaller pieces. We separate concerns so that if one component breaks down, the entire program doesn't break down. Restaurants and software programs use a design pattern known as the <span style = "color: #FE4646">**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**</span> to interact with data and control logic. This divides programming logic into three interconnected elements:
- **Model**: This is like the chef. It handles the data and logic and produces an output based on the input.
- **View**: This is like the menu or dinner plate. This is what the user sees on the page.
- **Controller**: This is like the waiter. This routes commands to the model and view parts.

## JavaScript Frameworks vs. Libraries

<span style = "color: #FE4646">**JavaScript libraries**</span> are collections of prewritten code snippets that can be used and reused to perform common JavaScript functions. React is a library that helps developers build user interfaces and single page applications. To get a basic React application up and running, you could use [Create React App by installing the React using](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app):

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

However, if you wanted a react-form, you would need to install an additional library by running:

```shell
npm i react-form
```

By contrast, a <span style = "color: #FE4646">**JavaScript framework**</span> is a full toolset that helps shape and organize your website or application. A JavaScript framework uses a MVC software design pattern. Some popular JavaScript design frameworks are:
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Ember](https://emberjs.com/)

While React is a JavaScript library, there are JavaScript frameworks that incorporate React. Some popular React Frameworks include:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

## Knowledge Check ‚úÖ

1. React is a
    - **library**
    - framework
    - MVC
    - Both a library and framework

2. What is the purpose of using the MVC Design Pattern?
    - Allows us to build restaurant applications
    - Allows us to build applications where the entire program is contained in a single file.
    - **Allows for separation of concerns within an application.**

3. What is the difference between a library and a framework?
    - Frameworks and libraries describe the same thing. We can use the terms interchangeably.
    - **Frameworks are a full toolset that helps shape and organize your website or application whereas libraries are collections of prewritten code snippets that can be used and reused to perform common functions.**
    - Libraries are a full toolset that helps shape and organize your website or application whereas frameworks are collections of prewritten code snippets that can be used and reused to perform common functions.
    - Frameworks use the MVC Design Pattern, whereas libraries do not use the MVC Design Pattern.
