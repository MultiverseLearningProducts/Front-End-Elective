**TASK**: Select the course for the framework that you selected in the previous section and complete the entire course. Make sure to complete all portions of the tutorial!

> Each tutorial utilizes different platforms to learn their frameworks with many offering built in IDEs. **We recommend using coding locally where possible or in external IDEs like StackBlitz for the Angular tutorial.**

> If you do code in their editors (Svelte, Vue, and Elm will require this), be sure to save the code in a local file so that you can refer back to it when you need to incorporate it into your project.
