## Presentation Day!

Today is the day! We will be showing each other our recorded presentations in class. The presentations today are your chance to teach others that did not take your elective about your topic and to learn from your peers that took electives that you did not take. For your presentations, you should:
- Share your videos with other members in your breakout room.
- Watch the video presentations as a group.
- Share out feedback on the project and presentation.
- Vote for your favorite that will be shared with the whole cohort.
