# Exercise: Stacks

You’re working on a contribution to the [TC39 ECMAScript spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) (a.k.a. JavaScript) to add native support for various Data Structures in JavaScript. Right now, you want to add a Stack to JavaScript. While JS does already have ways to store data similarly to a Stack (i.e. `Array`) it does not provide the usual Stack functionality.

Since the Stack is not natively built into JavaScript, we get to build our own implementation however we want. We’re going to use an array to hold onto memory, and a number to keep track of what index is at the top (or “head”) of the stack. Even though we’ll use an array for this, **we will not use any Array methods (i.e. push, pop, etc.).**

We should be able to use the stack like:

```javascript
const stack = new Stack();
stack.add('first thing').add('second thing');
stack.remove(); // => 'second thing'
stack.add('another thing');
stack.remove(); // => 'another thing'
stack.remove(); // => 'first thing'
stack.remove(); // => undefined
```

> Do not use any Array methods (i.e. `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, `splice`, etc.)

## 📝

### 1. Keep track of the state of the stack

We need a way to keep track of the current state of the stack. Particularly, we need a way to store all of the items in the stack and know what’s currently at the top of the stack.

1. Add the following properties to the class Stack constructor: `memory` and `head`
    - `memory` will hold all of the items in the stack as an array and `head` will point at what index is currently the top of the stack
    - Follow the tests (inspect the test results for hints) to help figure out what to initialize these properties with.
    - Hint: If you’re not sure what index the `head` should be, ask yourself if the stack is completely empty what index would be the top?
2. TESTS → This should PASS test 1

### 2. Add items to the stack

Implement the `add` functionality. The method is already defined, and currently it’s just returning `this`. That line is important - it’s so we can chain things together. e.g. `stack.add(‘first thing’).add(‘second thing’);`.

1. `add` should take an item, insert the item into the stack, and properly keep track of the top of the stack.
    - In other words: insert the item into memory at the current `head` position and then increment head to recognize that the stack has just grown
2. TESTS → This should PASS test 2

### 3. Remove items from the stack

Implement the `remove` functionality. The method is already defined, but it doesn’t actually do anything.

1. Calling `.remove()` should return the item that’s currently at the top of the stack, and properly keep track of the top of the stack

> It’s OK if `remove` doesn’t actually delete the item from the stack, but instead returns it and makes the index of that previous item now “available” to be filled by something new.

2. TESTS → This should PASS test 3

## Bonus

Here’s a couple things to try to expand the functionality of your Stack
- Implement the `peek` method
    - `peek` should return the item that’s currently at the top of the stack, but not remove it.
- Add a `maxSize` attribute and an `isFull` method that returns true or false depending on if we’ve reached the `maxSize` or not
- If we have `isFull`, then we should also have `isEmpty` that checks, well, if it’s empty!
