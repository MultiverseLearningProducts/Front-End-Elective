# Exercise: Queues

You just got hired as a software engineer by your local government to help improve the [DMV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_motor_vehicles). Currently it’s CHAOS when people come to get their driver’s licenses updated (or whatever else they’re there for)! Because the wait times are so long, nobody can remember who’s been there the longest or who’s up next to be served.

Your first task as a new public servant is to build a Queueing system to keep track of the order of the citizens in line to be served.

We should be able to use the queue like:

```javascript
const queue = new Queue();
// people entering the building
queue.add('Megan');
queue.add('Adam');
queue.add('Levi').add('Donna').add('Bethany'); // (a whole family came in!)

// time to serve someone!
queue.remove(); // => Megan

// someone else entered the building
queue.add('Henrietta');

// NEXT!
queue.remove(); // => Adam

// etc..
```

While we’re only working with `strings` for names, your Queue should be able to take anything (i.e. object, number, array, etc..). This shouldn’t change your implementation at all, but be aware that some of the tests will be using data types other than strings.

> Do not use any Array methods (i.e. `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, `splice`, etc.)

## 📝

### 1. Keep track of the state of the queue

We need a way to keep track of the current state of the queue, more particularly we need a way to store all of the people (items) in the queue and know who’s up next to be served, as well as where to add someone in the queue when they enter the building.

1. Add the following properties to the class constructor for Queue: `memory`, `head`, and `tail`.
    - `memory` will hold all of the people in the queue
    - `head` will point at what index is current in the very front of the queue
    - `tail` will keep track of where to put the next person who enters the building into the queue.
    - Follow the tests (inspect the test results for hints) to help figure out what to initialize these properties with.
    - Hint: if you’re not sure what index the head or tail should be, ask yourself if the queue is completely empty what index would be the front and the back?
2. This should PASS test 1

### 2. Add names to the queue

Now that we have the memory of the queue, we need to start populating it! People are flooding into the doors of the DMV and we need to keep track of who arrived first.

1. `add` is already present, but currently it’s only returning this (that’s important, so we can chain commands together, i.e. `queue.add(‘frank’).add(‘mac’).add(‘dennis’);`)
2. `add` should take an `item` (or, a person’s name), add it to memory, and properly keep track of the `tail` of the Queue.
    - **Remember**: A Queue is FIFO (First In, First Out). The first item that was added to the queue should always be the first item ready to be pulled out. Any items added after that are added to the back of the queue.
3. This should PASS test 2

### 3. Remove names from the queue

Your fellow public servant colleagues are ready to start serving the public, and they need to know who’s next in line to be served.

1. The method `remove` is already defined, but it’s not actually doing anything yet.
2. Calling `.remove()` should return whomever is currently at the front of the queue.
3. When someone is removed, the pointers should update accordingly.
    - **Remember**: Since a Queue is FIFO, items are removed from the front
4. If the queue is currently empty, calling `.remove()` should return `undefined`.

> It’s OK if the removed item isn’t actually deleted from memory. If you want to work that in, feel free to! But for our purposes, when we’ve built out the remove functionality properly.

5. This should PASS test 3

### Having trouble?

<details>

Since we have to both remove the first item from the array, and update the `head` (which currently points at the item we’re about to remove) we’ll have to first store the value of whatever is currently at the head in a temporary variable. Then, increment the head pointer, then return the temporary variable.

```javascript
const dequeued = this.memory[this.head];
this.head++;
return dequeued;
```

</details>

## Bonus

Your co-workers at the DMV would love a way to see who is next in line ahead of time so they can get prepared before they actually call “NEXT!”.
- Implement a `.first()` method that returns whomever is currently at the front of the line, without modifying head or tail.
- Likewise, implement a `.last()` method that returns whomever is currently at the back of the line.
