# üé• Recording Your Presentations üé•

Since we‚Äôll be presenting the recordings to each other next week, we‚Äôll need to record the presentations.  

> [Reference this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQqqhVR7Jz_8t8Z-OwtDIt6wCPFiebr1l3V4AFtArEScRPKzesMJsAiv98ZptmpnoxbTalmxf2_VzZT/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g1281e869de0_1_0) as a reminder how to record a presentation!  The slide deck is meant for another project, but the concepts for recording are the same: What to present, how to present it, and when to present it.

## Here are the steps that you can follow to record your videos:

1. With your team, explore video recording software and choose one to use. We recommend:
    - Loom (cool)
    - Zoom (easiest and works great!)
    - Quicktime (screen & face in one video is hard)
2. Create a script for your video
    - Follow the order of your presentation, and plan how you will make transitions between speakers.
3. Practice!
    - Do at least one ‚Äúrun through‚Äù of the presentation before you start recording. You don‚Äôt have to have everyone say every single line that they will do, but practice the introduction, transitions, and closing of the video
4. Record, Edit, & Upload to YouTube
    - Once you have recorded a version of the presentation that your team is happy with, upload it to YouTube.
5. Share the final link to your video below
