# Project Ideation

Considering that this is the Front End Elective, your project *should* primarily focus on the front end for this project.

⭐️ <span style = "color: #21B581">**This project will not primarily focus on the Back End, but depending on the project topic you can:**</span>
1. Use a free API from the **list below**
2. Create their own back end server
3. Use a cloud service back end like Google FireBase or MongoDB Atlas.

## Team Project Proposal
The premise of your app is entirely up to you and your team. Think through different ideas and come up with one. We’ve curated a collection of savory app ideas below. Use the list to get your creative juices going, but decide as a team and then submit a brief description below.

1. Briefly describe your app idea

## Suggestion: Use a Free/Public API
There are a ton of completely free-to-use JSON APIs available for you to consume. **Here is a GIANT list of Public APIs**:
- [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis)

Most of the APIs listed here contain documentation and sample data to get you up and running in no time at all. The APIs in this list are organized by category, so if you’re struggling for inspiration just browse the categories to see what’s available.

> We recommend using an API that has **No Auth** (the table in the linked repo has a column for **Auth**, just check for **“No”** in the column to make sure there’s no barrier for entry.)
> - If you are so inclined to use an API that requires authentication (i.e. it requires an `apiKey`) then follow the instructions in the API’s docs to find out how to procure a key. In most cases its as simple as creating an account with the API to get an automatically generated key, but sometimes it takes a manual response from a real human to supply the key and that could take days or weeks to acquire, and we don’t have the luxury of waiting right now.
