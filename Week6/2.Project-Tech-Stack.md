# Project Tech Stack

## Front End Tech Stack

This is the Front End Elective, so we have learned a lot more about the front end during the last set of lessons. Throughout this elective, you have learned about:
- CSS Animations
- SASS
- Redux
- JavaScript Frameworks

You should use the JavaScript Framework that you learned Week 5 in your final project. 

1. What JavaScript Framework (Angular, Vue, Next.js, etc.) are you using in your project?


## Back End Tech Stack

This project will not primarily focus on the Back End, but depending on the project topic you can:
- Use a free API from the **list we curated in the Front End Module (available in section 3 of the project guide as well)**
- Create their own back end server
- Use a cloud service back end like Google FireBase or MongoDB Atlas.

2. What are the technologies (tech stack) you will build the back end of your project in?

## Deployment Tech Stack

Use the cloud deployment provider of your choice. A few good ones to consider:
- Render
- Netlify
- Railway
- Vercel

Be sure to checkout the documentation for the framework you selected to see if there is a preferred deployment provider for that framework.

3. What are the technologies (tech stack) you will use for deployment of your project?
