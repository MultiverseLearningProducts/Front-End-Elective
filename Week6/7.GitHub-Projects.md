## Board Automations
Projects includes built-in workflows that you can use to update the Status of items based on certain events. For example, you can automatically set the status to Todo when an item is added to your project or set the status to Done when an issue is closed.

Itâ€™s up to the team if you want to use automations, but it can be very helpful. You can read more about [board automations here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/using-the-built-in-automations).



To setup an automated board, use the following steps:
1. In the top-right, click `. . .`  to open the menu.
