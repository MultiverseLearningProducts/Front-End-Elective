# Redux Slice & Action Hooks

If you and your roommate want pizza, but each of you has a favorite topping, you might settle for a half-and-half order: A pizza with one topping on one half and the other topping on the other half. That way, when you cut your own slice of pizza, it has your desired topping, and your roommate can do the same with their desired topping.

We can think of Redux store state in the same way: There are different types of data (user, notification, shopping cart, etc.). Redux Toolkit gives us a function, createSlice, allows us to create a "kind of state" that is separate from the rest of our store. We then combine it into the main store state along with the other slices we've created.

## Try It Out üíª
1. In `src/store` create a file called `counterSlice.js`. Import the [createSlice function from redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice) and call it to create a new slice called `counterSlice`. Pass in an empty object.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    // new file `src/store/counterSlice.js`
    import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

    export const counterSlice = createSlice({
        // more soon!
    });
    ```

    </details>

2. Give the object a `name` property equal to `'counter'`, and an `initialState` property whose value is an empty object with `value` set to `0`.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
    const initialState = { value: 0 };
    export const counterSlice = createSlice({
        name: 'counter',
        initialState,
        reducers: {
            increment: (state) => {
            state.value += 1
            }
        }
    });
    ```

    </details>

3. Add a `reducers` property which is an object with an `increment` method. Increment takes the current state and sets the `state.value` to one more than it was.
    - **NOTE**: Remember that we need to return a new version of the state instead of mutating state directly? That doesn't apply here. Immutability is taken care of by [Immer](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-8-modern-redux#immutable-updates-with-immer).

    <details>

    ```jsx
    import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
    const initialState = { value: 0 };
    export const counterSlice = createSlice({
        name: 'counter',
        initialState,
        reducers: {
            increment: (state) => {
            state.value += 1
            }
        }
    });
    ```

    </details>

4. Export the `counterSlice.actions` and `counterSlice.reducer` from this file, so it can be used later.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    export const { increment } = counterSlice.actions;
    export default counterSlice.reducer;
    ```

    </details>

5. In `src/App.js`, import the [useSelector hook](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#useselector) from react-redux.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    // src/App.js
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
    ```

    </details>

6. On the first line within the `App` component, the count can then be pulled out of the store state by calling `useSelector` and passing a callback. The first parameter of the callback is the store state, and we'll pull its value from `state.counter.value`.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
    ```

    </details>

7. Next, replace the `"count" here` in the `h1` with `{count}` instead. **You should see the value of the count displayed in the app. (currently 0)**
    <details>

    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

    export function App() {
        const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);

        return (
        <div>
            <header><h2>Multiverse Counter</h2></header>
            
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <div className="count-box">
            <button>Nothing here yet</button>
            </div>
        </div>
        );
    }
    ```

    </details>

8. Back in `src/store/index.js`, import the `counterSlice` and add it to the `reducers` object. This "connects" the `counterSlice` to our redux store.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
    import counterReducer from './counterSlice'; // new

    export const store = configureStore({
        reducer: {
            counter: counterReducer, // new
        },
    });
    ```

    </details>

9. Inside `src/App.js`, import `useDispatch` from `react-redux`, and call it right below where `useSelector` was called
    <details>

    ```jsx
    import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

    // ...

    // inside component
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    ```

    </details>

10. Add another import, this time pulling in `increment` from `src/counterSlice.js`.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    import { increment } from './counterSlice';
    ```

    </details>

11. Create an `onClick` event handler that calls `dispatch` and passes it the `increment` function.
    <details>

    ```jsx
    <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())} >
        Increment
    </button>
    ```

    </details>

## Knowledge Check ‚úÖ

1. Why are we allowed to mutate state directly instead of returning a new store state?
    - **Redux store state doesn't actually need to be immutable.**
    - **We are always supposed to mutate state in Redux.**
    - **Redux Toolkit takes care of the immutability of store state for us, behind the scenes**
2. Where are action types, action creators and reducers written?
    - In three different files
    - In the same file
    - **We don't need to write action creators and types: Redux Toolkit takes care of this for us.**
3. For usage in our React components, where do we import our action creators from, in order to pass their return values to the dispatch function?
    - react-redux
    - Redux Toolkit
    - **Our local slice module**
