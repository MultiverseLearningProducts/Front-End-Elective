# `react-redux`

We've created redux and connected it to React. But, we are calling `useEffect`, and then `subscribe` within that. We're 2 callbacks deep before we can even start doing anything with the state. Then we still have to call `store.getState` within the 2nd-level-deep callback! This seems almost worse than prop-drilling.

Why can't we just invoke a function and get our state at any given time? Enter `react-redux`.
