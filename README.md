# Front End Elective

Elective modules provide apprentices with the opportunity to delve more deeply into a topic that is relevant to their apprenticeship role and future career trajectory. Apprentices will work with their coaches and apprentice managers to determine the best elective for their role.

Apprentices that select this elective will deepen their overall knowledge of front end development. Apprentices will spend the first portion of the elective learning about CSS Animations, SASS, and Redux. Next, they will select a JavaScript Framework (Angular, Vue, Next.js, etc.) and complete an apprentice lead learning experience to teach themselves this framework. Finally, apprentices will integrate the skills they have learned from this module through the creation of a web application that incorporates the technologies they have learned.

After learning this content, apprentices will practice technical interviews that require them to apply these core CS concepts to a scenario they may encounter as they interview for future jobs.
