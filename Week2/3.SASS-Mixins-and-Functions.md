# SASS Mixins and Functions
One of the best part about using a library like React is the reusability of components. Wouldn't it be great if we had reusable components inside of CSS? With SASS, we DO!

‚≠ê <span style = "color: #21B581">**Mixins and Functions provide reusable CSS components and abstraction for common or repetitive logic.**</span>

### What We Will Learn
- Mixins
- Functions (built-in, and define your own)
- Passing arguments to mixins and functions

## Try It Out üíª

**GOAL**: Add a mixin and a function. Write your code in `src/main.scss`.

1. Add a mixin named `theme`. It can take a single argument (`$theme`) with a default value of `darkgray`.
    <details>

    ```scss
    @mixin theme($theme: darkgray) {
        background: $theme;
        box-shadow: 0 0 5px 1px rgba($theme, .25);
        color: #fff;
    }
    ```

    </details>

2. Using `@include`, do the following:
    - Inside `.info` include the `theme`
    - Inside `.alert` pass a `theme` of `DarkRed` 
    - Inside `.success` pass a `theme` of `DarkGreen`.
    <details>

    ```scss
    .info {
        @include theme;
    }

    .alert {
        @include theme($theme: DarkRed);
    }

    .success {
        @include theme($theme: DarkGreen);
    }
    ```

    </details>

3. Create a function called `weight` that takes a single argument of `$weight-name`. The function should grab the corresponding `weight` value from the `font-weights` variable using the passed in `weight-name`.
    - Use [SASS's built-in map-get](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map#get) to access that value on the `font-weights` map.
    <details>

    ```scss
    @function weight($weight-name) {
        @return map-get($font-weights, $weight-name);
    }
    ```

    </details>

4. Inside of alert add `font-weight: weight(bold);` and inside of success use `light` instead of bold. Try changing the values and watch the UI update accordingly!
    <details>

    ```scss
    .alert {
    @include theme($theme: DarkRed);

    font-weight: weight(bold);
    }

    .success {
    @include theme($theme: DarkGreen);

    font-weight: weight(light);
    }
    ```

    </details>

- **SASS**: [@map-get](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map#get)

## Knowledge Check ‚úÖ

1. What is the purpose of the` @include` directive in SASS?
    - Used to define a mixin
    - **Used to include a mixin in the document**
    - All of the above
    - None of the above

2. Which directive is used to define a mixin?
    - `@include`
    - **`@mixin`**
    - `@extend`
    - `@debug`

3. Given the following map and function call, which function would accurately access values from the map and return the requested value?
```scss
$theme-colors: (
    primary: #729ea1,
    alert: #f4d35e,
    danger: #db5375,
    black: #283d3b
)

.btn-primary {
    background-color: theme(primary);
}
```

****

```scss
@function theme($selector) {
    @return map-get($theme-colors, $selector);
}
```

****

```scss
@include theme($selector) {
    @return map-get($theme-colors, $selector);
}
```

```scss
@function theme($selector) {
    @return map-get($selector, $theme-colors);
}
```

```scss
@function theme {
    @return map-get($theme-colors);
}
```
